# üî¨ Electron vs Photon Classification | GSoC Project

This project is a part of my GSoC-related work involving the classification of electrons and photons using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores various approaches and preprocessing steps to build an effective classifier, using data provided from a high-energy physics context.

## üìå Project Overview

In high-energy physics experiments, identifying whether a particle is an electron or a photon is crucial. This notebook demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to:

- Preprocess and explore the dataset.
- Engineer relevant features.
- Train and evaluate classification models.
- Visualize performance metrics.
